# All HTML Elements

✨ View in your browser at [ADD LINK].

A simple list of all visible and style-able HTML elements. The list itself does not style any of these elements, so it's perfect for testing CSS frameworks, browser compatibility, and more.

⚠️ Find any issues or need to yell at me? Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/cyb/all-html-elements/issues) section.

## 🛠 Usage

In your terminal of choice, run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cyb/all-html-elements.git
```
This will create a folder titled `all-html-elements`. Just open the included `index.html` file with your browser. Probably the simplest install across all of Github.
